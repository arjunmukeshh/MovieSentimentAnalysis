# review_analysis
A project in ML to determine whether a particular review is positive or negative for a movie. Implemented using ML models in the Keras Library.
User inputs a review and the model predicts whether the user has supplied a positive one or a negative one.

The deployment of the model using Streamlit is in development.

Scope of the project could be extended to monitor comments on social media.

Tried to reproduce the code as on 22nd January, error due to preprocessed variable not being auto defined. Will ponder on solution soon.
